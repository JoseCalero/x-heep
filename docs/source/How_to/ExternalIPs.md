# add external IPs

This repository relies on [Vendor](https://opentitan.org/book/util/doc/vendor.html) to add new IPs. The `vendor.py` script in the [`./util`](./util/) folder implements what is describeb above, while [this](./ExternalDevices.md) file contains additional information on how to connect external devices to the system.
